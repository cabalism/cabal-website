Related Systems</A></H1><P>I will try to outline interesting points in a variety of systems
that we can learn from.  These systems may be intended for building or
installing packages, or repositories for packages.  I am not deeply
familiar with all of the tools here, and would be interested in
hearing more relevant points from someone with more knowledge.
Another weakness of mine is that I don't know much about Microsoft
Windows, so some good examples for Windows systems would be
helpful.</P><DIV CLASS="SECTION"><H1 CLASS="SECTION"><A NAME="LIP-APPENDIX-DEBIAN">A.1. Debian</A></H1><P>The Debian GNU/Linux system is a good example of a
<SPAN CLASS="emphasis"><I CLASS="EMPHASIS">binary</I></SPAN> distribution (meaning that packages are
distributed in binary, as opposed to source code form), and its
packaging system (<SPAN CLASS="APPLICATION">dpkg</SPAN>) is somewhat similar
to the more famous <SPAN CLASS="APPLICATION">RPM</SPAN>.  Debian has several
other tools to help the user to install packages, most notably,
<B CLASS="COMMAND">apt</B>.  The Debian toolset is interesting for several
reasons:

<P></P><UL><LI><P>It handles dependencies extremely well.  A single
  command can download and install a package, as well as downloading
  and installing all of its dependencies.</P></LI><LI><P>It handles updates extremely well.  One command
  (<B CLASS="COMMAND">apt-get update</B>) checks for new versions of
  packages and updates a local database.  Another command
  (<B CLASS="COMMAND">apt-get dist-upgrade</B>) downloads and installs all
  new versions of installed packages and any new
  dependencies.</P></LI><LI><P>There are standard commands for downloading and
  building packages from source.  If I'm interested in hacking on a
  package, I can run <B CLASS="COMMAND">apt-get source packagename</B>
  which will download and unpack the source code for the package.  The
  source can then be built with the standard command
  <B CLASS="COMMAND">debuild</B>.</P></LI><LI><P>The Debian Project maintains a central repository
  for packages, and the packaging tools offer support for using
  unofficial repositories as well.  The central repositories include a
  set of servers, the <SPAN CLASS="emphasis"><I CLASS="EMPHASIS">autobuilders</I></SPAN>, which compile
  uploaded source packages for a variety of hardware architectures
  (see below) and make them available as binary packages.  As a
  packager, I merely upload the source code to my package, and the
  autobuilders do the rest.</P></LI><LI><P>Currently the hardware architectures supported by
  Debian are Intel x86, Motorola 68k, Sun SPARC, Alpha, PowerPC, ARM,
  MIPS, HP PA-RISC, IA-64, S/390.  Debian also runs on non-Linux
  systems, including GNU/Hurd, GNU/NetBSD, and GNU/FreeBSD.  The
  package management tools also run on MacOS X under the name of the
  <SPAN CLASS="APPLICATION">Fink</SPAN> project.</P></LI></UL></P></DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="NAVFOOTER"><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="100%"><TABLE SUMMARY="Footer navigation table" WIDTH="100%" BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0"><TR><TD WIDTH="33%" ALIGN="left" VALIGN="top"><A HREF="x401.html" ACCESSKEY="P">Prev</A></TD><TD WIDTH="34%" ALIGN="center" VALIGN="top"><A HREF="index.html" ACCESSKEY="H">Home</A></TD><TD WIDTH="33%" ALIGN="right" VALIGN="top"><A HREF="x453.html" ACCESSKEY="N">Next</A></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="33%" ALIGN="left" VALIGN="top">Development Plan</TD><TD WIDTH="34%" ALIGN="center" VALIGN="top">&nbsp;</TD><TD WIDTH="33%" ALIGN="right" VALIGN="top">Python Distutils</TD></TR></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
