Distribution Module</A></H1><DIV CLASS="SECTION"><H2 CLASS="SECTION"><A NAME="LIP-BUILD">4.1. <CODE CLASS="CLASSNAME">Distribution.Build</CODE></A></H2><P>The basic strategy we will take for the actual task of building
Haskell tools is as follows:</P><P></P><UL><LI><P>For simple tools like Haskell modules, leverage
  <SPAN CLASS="APPLICATION">hmake</SPAN>'s (<A HREF="x504.html">Section A.7</A>) abilities and create a Haskell-based
  system (which will evolve to do more complex
  tasks.)</P></LI><LI><P>Tools that require something more complex can use
  ``fptools'' or Yale's Make-based system (<A HREF="x495.html">Section A.6</A>), or use their own build
  system.</P></LI><LI><P>All systems will be wrapped in a common veneer
  (<A HREF="x75.html#LIP-COMMAND">Section 3.3</A>) so they look the same to the average
  user and to layered tools (<A HREF="x393.html">Section 6</A>)
  and so that once <CODE CLASS="CLASSNAME">Distribution.Build</CODE> evolves to be a more robust tool,
  packages can transition to using it without effecting the interface
  to their build system.  </P></LI></UL><P>Since it is obviously the compilers that do the actual compilation,
the task of <CODE CLASS="CLASSNAME">Distribution.Build</CODE> is more one of coordination among tools
outside the compiler.  We hope to offer support for preprocessors
(both existing and those yet to come).  <CODE CLASS="CLASSNAME">Distribution.Build</CODE> will handle the
task of compiling for a particular Haskell Implementation, or for all installed
Haskell Implementations, and help to abstract-away differences between command-line
flags.</P><P><CODE CLASS="CLASSNAME">Distribution.Build</CODE> could also be used to recompile all of the installed
libraries once a new Haskell Implementation is installed.  This is an important
function, as it solves the problem of binary incompatibility between
Haskell Implementations and versions thereof.  Another very useful function that
<CODE CLASS="CLASSNAME">Distribution.Build</CODE> could offer is the implementation of a generic
<TT CLASS="FILENAME">/usr/bin/haskell</TT> that either executes a Haskell
program using the default compiler or throws the user into the default
interpreter, depending upon how it is invoked.  This allows Haskell
scripts (such as Setup.lhs) to be distributed with a
<B CLASS="COMMAND">#!/usr/bin/env haskell</B> annotation that has reasonable
behavior.</P></DIV><DIV CLASS="SECTION"><H2 CLASS="SECTION"><A NAME="LIP-INSTALL">4.2. <CODE CLASS="CLASSNAME">Distribution.Install</CODE></A></H2><P>The <CODE CLASS="CLASSNAME">Distribution.Install</CODE> module performs the task of moving files
  into place.  Presumably, this is the last task before package
  registration.  <CODE CLASS="CLASSNAME">Distribution.Install</CODE> will have to understand configuration
  options for the operating systems that Haskell modules are being
  installed on. (For instance, different operating systems have different
  policies for where to put documentation, source code, binary files,
  and libraries.)  Such information will most likely be read from a
  file that can be edited by the system administrator (<A HREF="x190.html#LIP-HASKELL-CONFIG">Section 4.4</A>).  </P><P>Not only will this module have to support standards on
  different operating systems, but it must have access to filesystem
  functionality like <B CLASS="COMMAND">copy</B> and
  <B CLASS="COMMAND">move</B>, as well as permission-related operations.
  Such functions should be offered by a library such as
  <CODE CLASS="CLASSNAME">System.Posix.Files</CODE> and
  <CODE CLASS="CLASSNAME">System.Directory</CODE>, but the
  <CODE CLASS="CLASSNAME">System.Posix</CODE> module is not available on all
  operating systems.  To some extent, <CODE CLASS="CLASSNAME">Distribution.Install</CODE> should handle the
  differences between operating systems (file permissions for
  instance), but Haskell should offer a more robust set of file
  operations in order to encourage the use of Haskell for common
  scripting tasks. (One issue that the author has noticed is that
  <CODE CLASS="FUNCTION">System.Directory.renameDirectory</CODE> is not
  implemented the same in GHC and Hugs, which forces <CODE CLASS="CLASSNAME">Distribution.Install</CODE> to
  find a way to abstract the differences.)</P></DIV><DIV CLASS="SECTION"><H2 CLASS="SECTION"><A NAME="LIP-PACKAGING">4.3. <CODE CLASS="CLASSNAME">Distribution.Package</CODE></A></H2><P>The complex task of packaging requires a lot of attention.
  The proposed solution is not only a module to access the packaging
  information, but also an application to assist external systems with
  the same task:</P><P>The main features of this system are:</P><P></P><OL TYPE="1"><LI><P>To let the Haskell Implementations know how to use a package,
   whether its available by default (or whether it requires a -package
   flag), and where the root of its hierarchy is.</P></LI><LI><P>To store other information about a package,
   including information such as its license, home page, version
   number, and dependencies, to be used by other tools in the
   <CODE CLASS="CLASSNAME">Distribution</CODE> hierarchy.</P></LI><LI><P>All information will be made available through the
   <CODE CLASS="CLASSNAME">Distribution.Package</CODE> module.  The information can be made available to
   non-haskell tools by way of a command-line tool, <SPAN CLASS="APPLICATION">haskell-config</SPAN>
   (<A HREF="x190.html#LIP-HASKELL-CONFIG">Section 4.4</A>) with easily parsable output
   (similar to <A HREF="http://www.freedesktop.org/software/pkgconfig/" TARGET="_top">package-config</A>)
   though a different solution may be necessary for
   windows.</P></LI></OL><P>Some secondary features are:</P><P></P><OL TYPE="1"><LI><P>Let other tools, such as debuggers and
   editors know where the source code for a module / package
   is.</P></LI><LI><P>When new Haskell implementations are installed,
   allow them to find the source code and import it into their own
   library tree (perhaps through other features of the
   L.I.P.)</P></LI><LI><P>For Haskell implementations that don't conform to
   the new packaging interface, implement a wrapper so that it can
   still utilize other important features of the Library
   Infrastructure Project.</P></LI></OL><P>The information would be held in a file, such as
<TT CLASS="FILENAME">/etc/haskell/packages.conf</TT><A NAME="AEN260" HREF="#FTN.AEN260"><SPAN CLASS="footnote">[1]</SPAN></A> and
