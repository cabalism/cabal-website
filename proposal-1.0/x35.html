Issues Facing Developers</A></H1><P>There are a number of issues facing developers of Haskell
  software when they decide to deploy their work.  </P><P></P><UL><LI><P>Binary incompatibility between Haskell
  Implementations and between versions of some implementations make it
  very difficult to distribute binary libraries: if they are expected
  to work together, all of the libraries on a user's system need to be
  built with the same compiler.  This makes it a virtual necessity
  that the source code for a Haskell library be distributed to the end
  user of that library, although other options exist for systems like
  Debian (<A HREF="a425.html#LIP-APPENDIX-DEBIAN">Section A.1</A>) which have
  auto-builders. </P></LI><LI><P>Compilation is difficult: It was noted above that it
  is usually necessary to distribute the source code for Haskell tools
  to the end user.  The end user has to compile each Haskell tool they
  use, but the task of compilation is complicated by a plethora of
  preprocessors (such as arrowp and greencard) and interfaces with
  non-Haskell libraries (such as Java, X, C, and GTK).  Further, there
  is no way to formally express dependencies between Haskell tools, so
  the users have to visit the home pages of the projects they're
  interested in and find the dependencies.  </P></LI><LI><P>The Haskell Implementations are not completely compatible either:
  They support different extensions, different libraries, different
  binary formats, different flags, and different packaging
  systems.</P></LI><LI><P>Given that compilation is difficult in and of
  itself, it is further complicated by a wide variety of target
  platforms that it is desirable to support.  These systems may treat
  files differently (copying of files, path names) or have different
  defaults for where to put compiled files or source code to make them
  available to the user.  The variety of Haskell Implementations and target platforms
  make writing of a generic build system that "just works" very
  difficult.</P></LI><LI><P>Having managed to compile and install all of the
  Haskell software they need, if a user installs a new compiler (or
  version thereof), all this work needs to be redone.  All of the
  libraries on the system will have to be recompiled to match the
  version of that compiler (this is apparently a bigger problem with
  GHC than with NHC, and not much of a problem with
  Hugs.)</P></LI></UL><P>Compare this to the experience of installing a typical library
  or tool written in C or C++ on a Debian GNU/Linux system: The user
  consults a database of known programs (which is stored on her
  computer) and runs a single command to install that package.  The
  package management tool figures out the dependencies, downloads all
  dependencies downloads the package, and installs them in the proper
  order.  The packages are already compiled by a set of central
  servers.  In fact, there is no reason that this kind of interface
  can't be available to the end user except for the difficulty of
  creating binary packages. (See <A HREF="x35.html#LIP-PROBLEMS-PACKAGERS">Section 2.1</A>) </P><DIV CLASS="SECTION"><H2 CLASS="SECTION"><A NAME="LIP-PROBLEMS-PACKAGERS">2.1. Issues Facing Packagers</A></H2><P>There are roughly speaking, three different kinds of
  operating-system package systems: source distributions (FreeBSD,
  Gentoo), binary distributions (Debian, RPM), and language-specific
  distributions (CPAN, XEmacs).  What we are proposing to create is a
  language-specific distribution that assists in the creation of both
  source and binary packages for other operating systems.</P><P>As mentioned above, it is possible to create an operating
  system package for a Haskell library.  Indeed, its no harder to
  create a Haskell package than any other kind of package; Haskell
  packages are harder to maintain, however.  For instance, in the
  Debian GNU/Linux system (<A HREF="a425.html#LIP-APPENDIX-DEBIAN">Section A.1</A>),
  which is a binary distribution, there is currently no way to express
  that a library needs to be recompiled when a new compiler is
  uploaded to the autobuilders.  Currently, the only solution is to
  re-upload library packages to the autobuilders at the same time you
  upload a new Haskell Implementation.  Similarly for Redhat, binary packages have to
  include the version number for <SPAN CLASS="APPLICATION">GHC</SPAN> that they were compiled
  with. </P><P> In a source distribution like FreeBSD (<A HREF="x481.html">Section A.4</A>), this isn't a problem, since the
  end user compiles all of their software themselves.  However, when the
  end user compiles and installs a new Haskell Implementation, all of the libraries
  compiled with the old Haskell Implementation will no longer work and need to be
  recompiled.  As I understand it, there is currently no means of
  performing this operation automatically.</P><P>Emacs / XEmacs presents packagers with some of the same
  issues; they are both, practically speaking, Lisp compilers, and
  incompatible, much like different versions of Haskell Implementations.  When an
  elisp package is installed on Debian, it gets compiled automatically
  (on the end user's machine) for each version of Emacs / XEmacs that
  is installed.  This procedure is orthogonal to the XEmacs Packaging
  System (<A HREF="x486.html">Section A.5</A>) and is a duplication
  of effort in some cases, but that is really the only way to make it
  work with Debian.  This has some ugly properties from Debian's
  standpoint: once compiled, there are files in the operating system
  that the packaging system doesn't know about.  These are similar to
  issues that Haskell packagers for Debian will have to face.</P></DIV><DIV CLASS="SECTION"><H2 CLASS="SECTION"><A NAME="LIP-PROBLEMS-SOLVE">2.2. Why We Should Solve This</A></H2><P></P><UL><LI><P>We need to evolve a decentralized way of
  distributing libraries.  The current model of distributing them with
  the Haskell Implementations puts too much strain upon the Haskell Implementation authors, and is not
  sustainable in the long-term.  If this continues, availability and
  reliability of libraries will suffer, and Haskell itself will suffer
  in the long-term as a rich set of libraries is becoming the standard
  for successful programming languages.</P></LI><LI><P>If we can help operating system packagers build
  packages (Debian, RPM, etc.), then we'll have more happy end
  users.</P></LI><LI><P>If we lower the cost of evaluating Haskell and
  Haskell tools, more people might try them out.</P></LI><LI><P>Many Haskell programs are developed as research
  prototypes and abandoned.  The subsequent bitrot makes it difficult
  for the community to take over the projects.  Formally specifying
  versioned dependencies and creating a central repository for Haskell
  tools can help solve this problem.</P></LI><LI><P>Active participation with the rest of the Free
  Software community (inclusion of Haskell in OS distributions,
  interoperability between Haskell tools and external libraries) can
  bring attention to Haskell and perhaps bring more talented
  developers into The Flock.</P></LI></UL></DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="NAVFOOTER"><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="100%"><TABLE SUMMARY="Footer navigation table" WIDTH="100%" BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0"><TR><TD WIDTH="33%" ALIGN="left" VALIGN="top"><A HREF="index.html" ACCESSKEY="P">Prev</A></TD><TD WIDTH="34%" ALIGN="center" VALIGN="top"><A HREF="index.html" ACCESSKEY="H">Home</A></TD><TD WIDTH="33%" ALIGN="right" VALIGN="top"><A HREF="x75.html" ACCESSKEY="N">Next</A></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="33%" ALIGN="left" VALIGN="top">Library Infrastructure Project</TD><TD WIDTH="34%" ALIGN="center" VALIGN="top">&nbsp;</TD><TD WIDTH="33%" ALIGN="right" VALIGN="top">A Solution for Haskell in Haskell</TD></TR></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
