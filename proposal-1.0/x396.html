Means of Distribution
  and Layered Tools</A></H1><P>Most of the discussion here has been about giving the user
  tools to build, install, and manage libraries and tools written in
  Haskell.  There is another important component to this which
  deserves attention, and that is the distribution of these tools.
  </P><P>  For C++ and Perl (and likely many other programming languages) there
  are central repositories of libraries and tools (<A HREF="x466.html">Section A.3</A>).  In a way, Haskell has this
  also, bit it is centrally maintained rather than being a
  free-for-all where nearly anyone can get their package distributed.
  The author feels that both approaches are appropriate, and libraries
  can graduate from one to the other.</P><P> Having a standard interface for installing packages allows us
  to layer tools upon it.  For instance, it would be nice to be able
  to download and install Haskell libraries and all their dependencies
  with one command.  For Perl (by virtue of CPAN) this is already
  possible.  Other layered tools are discussed in the Use Cases (<A HREF="x321.html">Section 5</A>).</P></DIV><DIV CLASS="NAVFOOTER"><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="100%"><TABLE SUMMARY="Footer navigation table" WIDTH="100%" BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0"><TR><TD WIDTH="33%" ALIGN="left" VALIGN="top"><A HREF="x321.html" ACCESSKEY="P">Prev</A></TD><TD WIDTH="34%" ALIGN="center" VALIGN="top"><A HREF="index.html" ACCESSKEY="H">Home</A></TD><TD WIDTH="33%" ALIGN="right" VALIGN="top"><A HREF="x403.html" ACCESSKEY="N">Next</A></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="33%" ALIGN="left" VALIGN="top">Use Cases</TD><TD WIDTH="34%" ALIGN="center" VALIGN="top">&nbsp;</TD><TD WIDTH="33%" ALIGN="right" VALIGN="top">Development Plan</TD></TR></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
