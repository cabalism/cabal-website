The Haskell Package System: overview</A></H1><P>This section summarises the vocabulary and main features of the Haskell Package System.</P><DIV CLASS="SECT2"><H2 CLASS="SECT2"><A NAME="PACKAGE-DESCR">2.1. Packages</A></H2><P>A <SPAN CLASS="emphasis"><I CLASS="EMPHASIS">package</I></SPAN> is the unit of distribution for the <SPAN CLASS="APPLICATION">HPS</SPAN>.
Its purpose in life, when installed, is to make available some Haskell modules for
import by some other Haskell program.   However, a package may consist of 
much more than a bunch of Haskell
modules: it may also have C source code and header files, documentation, test cases, auxiliary 
tools and whatnot.</P><P>Each package has:
<P></P><UL><LI><P>A globally-unique <SPAN CLASS="emphasis"><I CLASS="EMPHASIS">package name</I></SPAN>, containing no spaces. Chaos will result
if two distinct packages with the same name are installed on the same system.  How unique package names are
handed out is not part of this specification, but there will presumably be some global web site where
package authors can go to register a package name. </P></LI><LI><P>A <SPAN CLASS="emphasis"><I CLASS="EMPHASIS">version</I></SPAN>, consisting of a sequence of one or more integers.</P></LI><LI><P><SPAN CLASS="emphasis"><I CLASS="EMPHASIS">A list of explicit dependencies</I></SPAN> on other packages.  These are typically not exact; e.g. "I need <VAR CLASS="LITERAL">hunit</VAR> version
greater than 2.4".
	    </P></LI><LI><P><SPAN CLASS="emphasis"><I CLASS="EMPHASIS">A list of exposed modules</I></SPAN>.  Not all of the modules that comprise a package implementation are necessarily
exposed to a package client.
The ability to expose some, but not all, of the modules making up a package
is rather like using an explicit export list on a Haskell module.</P></LI></UL>
The first two components can be combined to form a single text string called the <SPAN CLASS="emphasis"><I CLASS="EMPHASIS">package ID</I></SPAN>, 
using a hyphen to separate the version
from the name, and dots to separate the version components.  For example, "hunit-2.3".</P></DIV><DIV CLASS="SECT2"><H2 CLASS="SECT2"><A NAME="PACKAGES-AND-HASKELL">2.2. Packages and the Haskell language</A></H2><P>A complete Haskell program will consist of one or more modules (including <VAR CLASS="LITERAL">Main</VAR>)
compiled against one or more packages (of which the Prelude is one).  These packages are not referred to
explicitly in the Haskell source; instead, the packages simply populate the hierarchical space of module names.</P><P>Complete programs must obey the following invariant.  <SPAN CLASS="emphasis"><I CLASS="EMPHASIS">Consider all the Haskell modules that
constitute a complete program: no two modules must have the same module name.</I></SPAN></P><P>This invariant is conservative.  It preserves the existing semantics of Haskell, and is 
relatively easy to implement.  In particular, the the full name of an entity (type, class, function), which is
used to determine when two entities are the same, is simply a pair of the module name and the entity name.</P><P>The invariant is unsatisfactory, however, because it does not support abstraction at
the package level. For example, a module with an internal (hidden, non-exposed) module called <VAR CLASS="LITERAL">Foo</VAR>
cannot be used in the same program as another package with an unrelated internal module also called <VAR CLASS="LITERAL">Foo</VAR>.
Nor can a program use two packages, P and Q, which depend on different versions of the same underlying package R.
We considered more sophisticated schemes, in which (for example) the package name, or package ID, is implicitly
made part of every module name.  But (a) there is a big design space, and (b) it places new requirements on the
implementations.  Hence a conservative starting point.</P></DIV><DIV CLASS="SECT2"><H2 CLASS="SECT2"><A NAME="AEN153">2.3. Packages and compilers</A></H2><P>We use the term ``compiler'' to mean <SPAN CLASS="APPLICATION">GHC</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="APPLICATION">Hugs</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="APPLICATION">Nhc98</SPAN>, hbc, etc.  (Even though
<SPAN CLASS="APPLICATION">Hugs</SPAN> isn't really a compiler, the term is less clumsy than ``Haskell implementation''.)</P><P> The
<SPAN CLASS="APPLICATION">HPS</SPAN> requires that a conforming Haskell compiler is somewhat package aware.
In summary, the requirements are these:
<P></P><UL><LI><P>Each compiler <B CLASS="COMMAND">hc</B> must provide an
associated package-management program <B CLASS="COMMAND">hc-pkg</B>.  A compiler user
installs a package by placing the package's supporting files
somewhere, and then using <B CLASS="COMMAND">hc-pkg</B> to make the compiler aware of the
new package.  This step is called <SPAN CLASS="emphasis"><I CLASS="EMPHASIS">registering the package
with the compiler</I></SPAN>.  </P></LI><LI><P>To
register a package, <B CLASS="COMMAND">hc-pkg</B> takes as input an <SPAN CLASS="emphasis"><I CLASS="EMPHASIS">installed
package description (IPD)</I></SPAN>, which describes the installed
form of the package in detail.  The format of an IPD is given in <A HREF="x251.html#IPD">Section 3.4</A>.</P></LI><LI><P>Subsequent invocations of <B CLASS="COMMAND">hc</B>
            will include modules from the new package in the module
            name space (i.e. visible to <VAR CLASS="LITERAL">import</VAR>
            statements).</P></LI><LI><P>The compiler should support
            <VAR CLASS="OPTION">-package</VAR> and
            <VAR CLASS="OPTION">-hide-package</VAR> flags for finer-grain
            control of package visibility.</P></LI></UL>

        A complete specification of these requirements is given in
        <A HREF="x251.html">Section 3</A>.</P></DIV><DIV CLASS="SECT2"><H2 CLASS="SECT2"><A NAME="AEN183">2.4. Package distributions</A></H2><P>A <SPAN CLASS="APPLICATION">HPS</SPAN> package can be distributed in several forms:
<P></P><UL><LI><P>A <SPAN CLASS="emphasis"><I CLASS="EMPHASIS"><SPAN CLASS="APPLICATION">HPS</SPAN> source distribution</I></SPAN> is a tree of files (tar-ball, zip file etc)
containing the <SPAN CLASS="APPLICATION">tool</SPAN>'s sources, which may need to be
compiled before being installed.  The same source tarball may well be installable for several
Haskell implementations, OSs, and platforms.
	    </P><P>A source distribution may contain fewer files than appear in the developer's CVS repository; for example,
tests and design notes may be omitted.  It may also contain some derived files, that do not appear in the
the developer's repository; for example, ones made by a somewhat exotic pre-processor where it
seems simpler to ship the derived file than to ensure that all consumers have the pre-processor.</P></LI><LI><P>A <SPAN CLASS="emphasis"><I CLASS="EMPHASIS"><SPAN CLASS="APPLICATION">HPS</SPAN> binary distribution</I></SPAN> is a tree of files that contains a pre-compiled <SPAN CLASS="APPLICATION">tool</SPAN>, ready
for installation.  The pre-compilation means that the distribution will be Haskell-compiler-specific, and certain 
"looser" dependencies (<VAR CLASS="LITERAL">hunit > 2.3</VAR>) will now be precisely fixed (<VAR CLASS="LITERAL">hunit == 2.4</VAR>).
	    </P></LI><LI><P>The package may be wrapped up as an <SPAN CLASS="emphasis"><I CLASS="EMPHASIS">RPM</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="emphasis"><I CLASS="EMPHASIS">Debian</I></SPAN> package, 
or <SPAN CLASS="emphasis"><I CLASS="EMPHASIS">Windows installer</I></SPAN> (this list is not exhaustive).
In that case, the way it is installed is prescribed by the respective distribution mechanism;
the only role of the <SPAN CLASS="APPLICATION">HPS</SPAN> is to make it easy to construct such distributions. All three are
compiler-specific (indeed compiler-version-specific) binary distributions.
	    </P></LI></UL></P></DIV><DIV CLASS="SECT2"><H2 CLASS="SECT2"><A NAME="AEN207">2.5. The Setup script</A></H2><P>The key question is this: how should Angela Author present her <SPAN CLASS="APPLICATION">HPS</SPAN> package so that 
her consumers (Bob, Sam, Willie, etc) can conveniently use it?</P><P>Answer: she provides a tree of files, with two specific files in the
root directory of the tree:  
<P></P><UL><LI><P><TT CLASS="FILENAME">pkg.desc</TT> contains a short description of the package:
specifically, the package name, version, and dependencies.  It may also contain further information
specific to the particular build system.  The syntax of the package description file
is given in <A HREF="x422.html#PKG-DESC">Section 4.1</A>.
	    </P></LI><LI><P><TT CLASS="FILENAME">Setup.lhs</TT> is an executable Haskell program 
which conforms to a particular specification, given in detail in <A HREF="x422.html">Section 4</A>.
In summary, though, <TT CLASS="FILENAME">Setup.lhs</TT> allows a consumer to configure, build,
test, install, register, and unregister a package.  </P></LI></UL>
The <SPAN CLASS="APPLICATION">HPS</SPAN> allows a package author to write the setup script in any way she pleases, provided
it conforms to the specification of <A HREF="x422.html">Section 4</A>.  However, many Haskell packages consist
of little more than a bunch of Haskell modules, and for these the <SPAN CLASS="APPLICATION">HPS</SPAN> provides <SPAN CLASS="emphasis"><I CLASS="EMPHASIS">the simple
build infrastructure</I></SPAN>, a Haskell library that does
all the work.  The simple build infrastructure, which was used for the example in 
<A HREF="index.html#EXAMPLE">Section 1.2</A>, is described in <A HREF="x581.html">Section 5</A>.</P><P>In principle, the <VAR CLASS="LITERAL">Setup</VAR> script
could be written in any language; so why do we use Haskell?
<P></P><UL><LI><P>Haskell runs on all the systems of interest.</P></LI><LI><P>Haskell's standard libraries should include a rich set of operating
system operations needed for the task.  These can abstract-away the
differences between systems in a way that is not possible for
Make-based tools.</P></LI><LI><P>Haskell is a great language for many things, including tasks
typically relegated to languages like Python.  Building, installing,
and managing packages is a perfect proving ground for these tasks, and
can help us to discover weaknesses in Haskell or its libraries that
prevent it from breaking into this "market".  A positive side-effect
of this project might be to make Haskell more suitable for "scripting"
tasks.</P></LI><LI><P>Likewise, each piece of the project (Building, Installing, and
Packaging) can be leveraged elsewhere if we make them into
libraries.</P></LI><LI><P>Make is not particularly good for parsing, processing, and sharing
meta-information about packages.  The availability of this information
to Haskell systems (including compilers, interpreters, and other
tools) is useful.  Unlike Make, Haskell can also reuse unrelated
algorithms, parsers, and other libraries that have been developed in
the past.</P></LI><LI><P><SPAN CLASS="emphasis"><I CLASS="EMPHASIS">Dogfooding</I></SPAN>, the act of using the tools you
develop, is a healthy policy.</P></LI></UL>
It is convenient for consumers to execute <TT CLASS="FILENAME">Setup.lhs</TT> directly, thus:
<PRE CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING">  ./Setup.lhs ...</PRE>
This can be achieved by starting <TT CLASS="FILENAME">Setup.lhs</TT> with "<VAR CLASS="LITERAL">#! runhugs</VAR>"
or "<VAR CLASS="LITERAL">#! runghc</VAR>" .
Since it's a literate Haskell script (<VAR CLASS="LITERAL">.lhs</VAR> file), the Haskell compiler will ignore
this line.
However, nothing stops a consumer from running the script interactively, or compiling it and running 
the compiled binary.  Any implementation of Haskell should suffice to run the script, provided 
the implementation has the <SPAN CLASS="APPLICATION">HPS</SPAN> libraries installed.
