and (b) a setup script, <TT CLASS="FILENAME">Setup.lhs</TT>.
This section
specifies the syntax of the package description, and the command-line interface for the setup script.</P><DIV CLASS="SECT2"><H2 CLASS="SECT2"><A NAME="PKG-DESC">4.1. The package description</A></H2><P>Here is a sample package description file:

The first two lines are compulsory. The dependencies are optional, assumed empty if omitted. 
There can be more lines, all of the form <SPAN CLASS="emphasis"><I CLASS="EMPHASIS">name: stuff</I></SPAN>, specific to the particular
setup script in use.  For the <SPAN CLASS="APPLICATION">HPS</SPAN>-provided simple build infrastructure, the package description syntax
is given in <A HREF="x581.html#SBI-PKG-DESC">Section 5.2</A>.</P><P>The exact syntax is still undecided.  Should we put everything in quotes?
<PRE CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING">  deps:    [ "foogle > 2.9", "bargle = 2.5.1" ]</PRE>

        prepares to build the package.  For sophisticated packages,
        the configure step may perform elaborate checks, to gather
        information about the target system.  It may write a file to
        record its results, but the name and format of this file are
        not part of the specification.</P><P>All flags are optional.  The flags are these:</P><P></P><UL><LI><P><VAR CLASS="OPTION">--with-compiler=</VAR><VAR CLASS="REPLACEABLE">path</VAR>, 
<VAR CLASS="OPTION">--ghc</VAR>, 
<VAR CLASS="OPTION">--nhc</VAR>, 
<VAR CLASS="OPTION">--hugs</VAR>: 
specifies which compiler to use.  At most one of the value of these flags may be specified.
The configure step checks
that the compiler is available, in a sufficiently up-to-date form for the package, and that the package
expects to work with that compiler.  If the compiler name
is not specified, <VAR CLASS="LITERAL">setup</VAR> will choose one; some packages will come with one compiler baked in.</P></LI><LI><P><VAR CLASS="OPTION">--prefix=</VAR><VAR CLASS="REPLACEABLE">path</VAR>: specifies where the installed files
for the package should be installed.  Typically on Unix this will be <TT CLASS="FILENAME">/usr/local</TT> and
on Windows it will be <TT CLASS="FILENAME">Program Files</TT>.  The setup script will use a sensible default
(often platform-specific) if the flag is not specified.
	    </P></LI><LI><P>Unrecognized flags are errors in the default build system, but may be meaningful to wrapped make-based systems (for instance).  Therefore, the provided command-line parser will pass unrecognized command-line flags on to the wrapped system.</P></LI></UL><P>It is OK for these flags to be "baked into" the compiled
        <SPAN CLASS="APPLICATION">tool</SPAN>.  In particular, the build system may bake the
        installation path into the compiled files.  There is no
        provision for changing these baked-into values after
        configuration.</P></DIV><DIV CLASS="SECT3"><H3 CLASS="SECT3"><A NAME="AEN502">4.2.2. <VAR CLASS="OPTION">build</VAR></A></H3><P>The command <VAR CLASS="LITERAL">./Setup.lhs build</VAR> makes
        this package ready for installation.  It takes no
        flags.</P></DIV><DIV CLASS="SECT3"><H3 CLASS="SECT3"><A NAME="AEN507">4.2.3. <VAR CLASS="OPTION">install</VAR></A></H3><P>The command <VAR CLASS="LITERAL">./Setup.lhs install</VAR>
        copies files from the built package to the right location for
        installed files, specified in the configure step.  Then it
        registers the new package with the compiler, using the
        <B CLASS="COMMAND">hc-pkg</B> command.</P><P></P><UL><LI><P><VAR CLASS="OPTION">--install-prefix=</VAR><VAR CLASS="REPLACEABLE">path</VAR>
            has three effects.  First, it over-rides the
            <VAR CLASS="OPTION">--prefix</VAR> flag specified in the
            <VAR CLASS="OPTION">configure</VAR> step, providing an
            alternative location.  Second, it does not call
            <B CLASS="COMMAND">hc-pkg</B> to register the package.
            Instead, third, it creates an installed package
            description file,
            <TT CLASS="FILENAME">installed-pkg-descr</TT>, which can later
            be fed to <B CLASS="COMMAND">hc-pkg</B>.
	    </P></LI><LI><P><VAR CLASS="OPTION">--user</VAR>: if present, this flag is
            passed to <B CLASS="COMMAND">hc-pkg</B> so that the package is registed for the
            current user only.  This flag has no effect if
            <VAR CLASS="OPTION">--install-prefix</VAR> is used, because in
            that case <B CLASS="COMMAND">hc-pkg</B> is not called.</P></LI><LI><P><VAR CLASS="OPTION">--global</VAR>: if present, this flag is
            passed to <B CLASS="COMMAND">hc-pkg</B> so that the package is registed
            globally (this is the default if neither
            <VAR CLASS="OPTION">--user</VAR> or <VAR CLASS="OPTION">--global</VAR> are
            given).</P></LI></UL><P>The reason for the <VAR CLASS="OPTION">--install-prefix</VAR>
        flag is that Roland RPM wants to create an exact installation
        tree, all ready to bundle up for the target machine,
        <SPAN CLASS="emphasis"><I CLASS="EMPHASIS">but in a temporary location</I></SPAN>. He cannot
        use this location for <VAR CLASS="OPTION">--prefix</VAR> in the
        <VAR CLASS="OPTION">configure</VAR> step, because that might bake
        the wrong path into some compiled files.  Nor does he want to
        register this temporary tree with the compiler on his
        machine. Instead, he bundles up the temporary installation
        tree, plus the <TT CLASS="FILENAME">installed-pkg-descr</TT>, and
        ships them all to the target machine.  When they are installed
        there, the post-installation script runs
        <B CLASS="COMMAND">hc-pkg</B> on the
        <TT CLASS="FILENAME">installed-pkg-descr</TT> file.
	    </P><P>Note that there is no <B CLASS="COMMAND">uninstall</B>
        command in the setup script.  While it would be easy enough to
        implement in the simple build infrastructure, we don't want to
        require make-based build systems to implement <VAR CLASS="LITERAL">make
        uninstall</VAR>, which is fairly non-standard and
        difficult to get right.  In the majority of cases, we expect
        libraries to be installed via a package manager (eg. RPM,
        Debian APT), which already provide uninstallation
        services.</P></DIV><DIV CLASS="SECT3"><H3 CLASS="SECT3"><A NAME="AEN546">4.2.4. <VAR CLASS="OPTION">register</VAR> and
	<VAR CLASS="OPTION">unregister</VAR></A></H3><P>The command <VAR CLASS="LITERAL">./Setup.lhs register</VAR>
        registers the now-installed package with the compiler.
        Similarly, <VAR CLASS="LITERAL">./Setup.lhs unregister</VAR>
        un-registers the package.</P><P></P><UL><LI><P><VAR CLASS="OPTION">--global</VAR>: registers/un-registers a

Examples</A></H2><DIV CLASS="SECT3"><H3 CLASS="SECT3"><A NAME="AEN562">4.3.1. Bob the Builder and Sam Sysadmin</A></H3><P>Bob the Builder can install a <SPAN CLASS="APPLICATION">HPS</SPAN> source distribution thus.
He downloads the source distribution and unpacks it into a temporary directory,
<VAR CLASS="LITERAL">cd</VAR>'s to that directory, and says
<PRE CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING">  ./Setup.lhs configure --ghc
  ./Setup.lhs build
  ./Setup.lhs install --user</PRE>
Similarly, Sam Sysadmin does exactly the same, except that he says 
<PRE CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING">  ./Setup.lhs install --global</PRE>
in the final step, so that the package is installed where all users will see it.
      </P><P>For a binary distribution, both Bob and Sam would omit the first two steps, and just do the install step.</P></DIV><DIV CLASS="SECT3"><H3 CLASS="SECT3"><A NAME="AEN570">4.3.2. System packagers (Debian, RPM etc)</A></H3><P>System packagers, such as Donald Debian, will run the configure and build steps just like Bob and Sam.
A that point, Donald will say
<PRE CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING">  ./Setup.lhs install --install-prefix=/tmp/donald</PRE>
to construct a ready-to-zip tree of all the installed files, plus a file <TT CLASS="FILENAME">installed-pkg-descr</TT>
that describes the installed package.  He arranges to deliver both these components to the target machine,
and then feed <TT CLASS="FILENAME">installed-pkg-descr</TT> to <B CLASS="COMMAND">hc-pkg</B> on the target machine.
      </P><P>The file <TT CLASS="FILENAME">installed-pkg-descr</TT> also
        contains information he needs for building his Debian
        distribution, namely the package name, version, and (exact)
        dependencies.</P><P>We expect there to be additional tools to help System
	Packagers to prepare the materials necessary to build their
	packages from a source distribution.  For example, an RPM tool
	could take a Haskell package source distribution and build an
	initial <VAR CLASS="LITERAL">.spec</VAR> file with as many of the
	fields as possible filled in automatically.  In most cases
	some intervention by the System Packager will be necessary;
	for example platform-specific dependencies may need to be
	specified.</P></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV CLASS="NAVFOOTER"><HR ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="100%"><TABLE SUMMARY="Footer navigation table" WIDTH="100%" BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0"><TR><TD WIDTH="33%" ALIGN="left" VALIGN="top"><A HREF="x251.html" ACCESSKEY="P">Prev</A></TD><TD WIDTH="34%" ALIGN="center" VALIGN="top"><A HREF="index.html" ACCESSKEY="H">Home</A></TD><TD WIDTH="33%" ALIGN="right" VALIGN="top"><A HREF="x581.html" ACCESSKEY="N">Next</A></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="33%" ALIGN="left" VALIGN="top">What the compilers must implement</TD><TD WIDTH="34%" ALIGN="center" VALIGN="top">&nbsp;</TD><TD WIDTH="33%" ALIGN="right" VALIGN="top">The <SPAN CLASS="APPLICATION">HPS</SPAN> simple build infrastructure</TD></TR></TABLE></DIV></BODY></HTML>
